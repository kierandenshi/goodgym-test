# Ruby-on-Rails-test

Technical test 

## Brief
GoodGym organises sessions where you do good and get fit all across the UK. There are hundreds of sessions taking place in the country every day. 

We would like you to build a rails backend to serve a frontend (preferably react) which you also have to build. The frontend should display sessions, ability for users to sign up to a session, confirmation those users have signed up and display of the number of users signed up for the session. 

Data structure

```goodgymer
  - name
  - area_id

session
  - name
  - area_id
  - registration_limit

registration
  - goodgymer_id
  - session_id
```

Example of a Session card:

### Instructions
Please implement this feature using Ruby on Rails and React.

Please consider providing suitable documentation (e.g. a README) and simple tests.

Weâ€™re not expecting you to take days to build this - ideally this should take no more than a few hours.
